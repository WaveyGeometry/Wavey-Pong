### üéÆ **Gameplay Overview**

At its core, Pong Legends plays like traditional Pong: two paddles, one ball, and a battle to reach the score limit. But there‚Äôs much more going on under the hood.

- **Player vs AI**: You control the left paddle, while the right side is managed by a smart AI opponent. The AI becomes faster and more strategic as your level increases, providing an ongoing challenge.
- **Controls**: Use keyboard arrows (desktop) or responsive touch zones (mobile) to move your paddle up and down. The game supports both input types seamlessly.
- **Scoring**: Earn a point by getting the ball past the AI. First to reach the **win threshold** wins the match. This threshold increases as you level up, making higher matches more intense.

- **Level Scaling**: Higher levels unlock access to more features like exclusive skins and tougher AI opponents.
